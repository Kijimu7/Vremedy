## Inspiration
Over 40 million adults experience anxiety in the U.S.
They were diagnosed with anxiety disorder and put on medications or have to visit therapy. Those things will cost a lot of amounts money. Gives more anxiety. 
I wanted to create a VR app that helps those people who suffer from an anxiety disorders. Also, no need to spend a lot of money on their treatment with Vremedy.

## What it does
Vremedy is a new way of therapy. Traditional therapy costs a lot and some people are not able to afford it. There are a lot of people who suffer from anxiety but have no solutionâ€¦

The Vremedey is based on exposure therapy and it will allow us to confront the fear and deal with the situations. Also, it will allow us to learn a strategy to defeat the fear.

Currently, Vrmedy has 3 different anxiety situations

Crowded people
Job Interview
Spider

Vremery also provides the strategy videos:

Breathing
Dance Video
Tapping

The intention of the Vrmedy is a user feels like playing a game but actually practicing and building mussel memories to prepare themselves for real situations of anxiety.

## How I built it
- Unity
- MRTK 3
- Canva

## Challenges I ran into
At first, I was planning to build the anxiety trigger situations from scratch using 3d models. However, I realized I didn't have time to implement all the models so I decided to use the youtube 360 videos instead. It worked out pretty well.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
The 360 immersive environments that trigger anxiety is my accomplishment! So that a user can experience close to real situations and practices. 


## What I learned
- MRTK3 is easy to implement and it is nice that they are providing ready-to-use presets.
- How to implement 360 videos and optimize in Unity 


## What's next for Vremedy
- Adding Gratitude strategy video, and more anxiety trigger event situations.
- Improve UI.
